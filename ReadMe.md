# Master of Science - Data Science
Completed through Eastern University, coursework includes:
- Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- Statistics and Probability, including good depth into Inferential Statistics
- In-depth statistical and modeling work in R Statistical Programming Language
- Coverage of SQL for data manipulation and retrieval (I already have 20+ years as a DB guy though)
- In-depth machine learning work in (mostly) Python and (secondarily) R.

This repo includes various example files and homework from the Data Science MS program...contents will change periodically as I add assignments I've completed, etc.
